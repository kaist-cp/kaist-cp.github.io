I am an **Undergraduate Student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr) and [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr)**.
I am interested in developing good algorithms to achieve higher efficiency by concurrency and building system programs using Rust, so I contacted [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr).
