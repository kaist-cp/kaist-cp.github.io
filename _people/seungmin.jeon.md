I am an **Undergraduate Student at [Chungnam National University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.cnu.ac.kr/)**. I joined [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr) because I'm interested in designing concurrent and parallel systems and studying how to research these topics. 

Thankfully, I am working on designing a practical [persistent memory library](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/pmem), one of my interesting topics.
