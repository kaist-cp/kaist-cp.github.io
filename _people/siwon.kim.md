I am an **Undergraduate Student at [KAIST Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr) and double majored in [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)**.    


I am interested in optimizing computer systems with both algorithmic way and structural way. I joined [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr) to learn how to 'research' and study more about computer systems.
