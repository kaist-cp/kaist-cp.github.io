## Onboarding

Welcome to the lab! Please finish reading this document and do all the action items.

### What is Research?

> "Research is what I am doing when I don't know what I am doing," Wernher von Braun

The defining characteristic of research is everything---from motivation to methods to evaluation to
goal---is tentative: in the middle of doing research, you don't know what will be the end result. As
a consequence, a researcher will suffer everyday from:

- **Failures**. You don't know what you're doing, so you'll fail almost always. To deal with
  the frustration from such failures, you should be mentally tough enough to tolerate such
  frustration. If successful, from time to time you will be able to understand or design small
  things, which accumulate to a paper and a thesis.

- **Changing plans**. You don't know what you're doing, so your goal will be changing as you make
  progress on your project. So any long-term plan is destined to be significantly revised. Thus you
  should think of the goal as a ever-moving target, the current version being just the best possible
  approximation of the actual end result. Your goal should be neither too concrete nor too abstract:
  if too concrete, it will not be resilient to the revision; if too abstract, it will not guide your
  research.



### Management Principles

To get things done despite the fundamental uncertainty of research, this lab (ironically) aims to keep tangential uncertainty to the minimum.
All uncertainty are not created equal.
Some uncertainty, such as confusion on schedule or communication, is not beneficial for productivity.
On the other hand, other uncertainty, such as unexplored design spaces, is the very definition of research.
To be productive, we need to keep the former to the minimum and control the latter to the appropriate amount.
(The meaning of "the appropriate amount" constitutes a researcher's character; at first, please follow Jeehoon's taste.)

To minimize the unnecessary uncertainty, this lab enforces a small number of rules on communication.
Rules are good at minimizing confusions.
For example, is it okay to mention someone in chatting applications during night time?
People have vastly different opinion on this, possibly causing unnecessary tension among them, so we want to *define* whether it's acceptable or rude in a rule.
(FYI, we allow night-time mentions, but you're required to react to them only in work hours.)
On the other hand, rules are hard to follow if there are so many.
So we want to keep the number of rules as low as possible.



### Communication

#### Asynchronous Communication

- **Always, strongly prefer asynchronous communication**: the receiver is not required to reply promptly.
  If you can say something asynchronously, please do it so as early as possible.
  For example, you want Jeehoon to review your document, please send it to him as soon as you finish writing it. Don't wait for the meeting time to come.
  Please address Jeehoon's comments as soon as possible, and when it's done, please notify him of the progress.

- Even for asynchronous communication, try to reply within 12 hours.

- Before asking for a synchronous meeting (face-to-face or online), write down a meeting agenda and share it.
  In the agenda, clearly state the purpose of meeting. It can be, but not limited to: (1) reporting the progress, (2) asking questions/opinions, or (3) just chatting.
  If you have multiple things to discuss, enumerate them at the beginning of a meeting for better planning of the meetings.

    + If you don't send an agenda, the meeting is potentially going to be canceled.
    + If the meeting is to discuss a document, please send it at least by 12 hours before the meeting so that the others can review it.
      Share it anyway even if you couldn't finish writing the document by the time, because the others need to start making comments on it.


#### Volume

- **At 10am and 3pm everyday, please leave about five sentences to the [daily log](https://cp-chat.kaist.ac.kr/#narrow/stream/16-daily-log)** about what you'll do and what you've done for the day.

- **Schedule at least one meeting for at least 15 minutes a week with Jeehoon**.
  It can be about anything such as research, coursework, TA...

#### Reliability

- **Make sure that no feedbacks or action items get ignored.**
  More concretely, when you receive a feedback, address it or give a counterargument against it.
  When you're not capable of doing action items by their deadline, please say so as early as possible.
    + If you're reliable on this, the others can depend on you to get things done.
      If you're unreliable and you miss feedbacks or action items, the others also need to track them, which causes great management cost.

- **Right after every meeting, write down and share action items** in the corresponding Zulip topics (Team stream or DM).
  Example:

        - rv6 PR #131 적정 단계에서 끊어서 마무리
        - rv6 issue #124 검토
        - XX에 대해 정리하여 공유

- Don't say yes (or no) if you're not sure about it.
  Don't say you understood something if you don't.
  If there are some points that you do not understand clearly during the discussion, ask as soon as possible.

- Don't be angry or grumpy when the discussion is getting hotter.
  *Hot discussion* is absolutely necessary for research and any other creative works, but it's hot because different opinions are clashing.
  It should not be hot because different emotions are clashing.

- Cleary distinguish what you cannot agree on and what is not important.
  Even if you don't agree with an argument, please faithfully treat and document it (esp. that you don't agree with it).

#### Writing and speaking skills

- **Try to be direct, top-to-bottom, and conclusion-first**.

- **Read how to write papers and give talks by [Dr. Derek Dreyer](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/)**:
    + [How to write papers so people can read them](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw16.pdf), PLMW@POPL 2016
    + [How to give talks that people can follow](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw18popl.pdf), PLMW@POPL 2018
    + [How to write papers and give talks that people can follow](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw17icfp.pdf), PLMW@ICFP 2017

- **Use Derek's CGI model** when summarizing papers or writing proposals.
  Here's [an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8coma11JFp0JIaVqFnZYkEa0sBkgZ1ijTSh6j8c_Gw).
