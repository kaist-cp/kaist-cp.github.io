  abstract: "Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a cutting-edge storage technology that promises the
             performance of DRAM with the durability of SSD. Recent work has proposed several
             <em>persistency models</em> for mainstream architectures such as Intel-x86 and Armv8,
             describing the order in which writes are propagated to NVM. However, these models have
             several limitations; most notably, they either lack operational models or do not support
             persistent synchronization patterns.
             <br />
             <br />
             We close this gap by revamping the existing persistency models. First, inspired by the
             recent work on promising semantics, we propose a <em>unified operational style</em> for
             describing  persistency using <em>views</em>, and develop view-based operational
             persistency models for Intel-x86 and Armv8, thus presenting the <em>first</em> operational
             model for Armv8 persistency. Next, we propose a <em>unified axiomatic style</em> for
             describing hardware persistency, allowing us to recast and repair the existing axiomatic
             models of Intel-x86 and Armv8 persistency. We prove that our axiomatic models are equivalent
             to the authoritative semantics reviewed by Intel and Arm engineers. We further prove that
             each axiomatic hardware persistency model is equivalent to its operational counterpart.
             Finally, we develop a persistent model checking algorithm and tool, and use it to verify
             several representative examples."

  abstract: "All pointer-based nonblocking concurrent data structures should deal with the problem
             of <em>safe memory reclamation</em>: before reclaiming a memory block, a thread should
             ensure no other threads hold a local pointer to the block that may later be
             dereferenced.  Various safe memory reclamation schemes have been proposed in the
             literature, but none of them satisfy the following desired properties at the same time:
             <em>(i) robust</em>: a non-cooperative thread does not prevent the other threads from
             reclaiming an unbounded number of blocks; <em>(ii) fast</em>: it does not incur
             significant time overhead; <em>(iii) compact</em>: it does not incur significant space
             overhead; <em>(iv) self-contained</em>: it neither relies on special hardware/OS
             supports nor intrusively affects execution environments; and <em>(v) widely
             applicable</em>: it supports many data structures.
             <br />
             <br />
             We introduce PEBR, which we believe is the first scheme that satisfies all the
             properties above.  PEBR is inspired by Snowflake's hybrid design of pointer- and
             epoch-based reclamation schemes (PBR and EBR, resp.) that is mostly robust, fast, and
             compact but neither self-contained nor widely applicable.  To achieve
             self-containedness, we design algorithms using only the standard C/C++ concurrency
             features and process-wide memory fence.  To achieve wide applicability, we characterize
             PEBR's requirement for safe reclamation that is satisfied by a variety of data
             structures, including Harris's and Harris-Herlihy-Shavit's lists that are not supported
             by PBR.  We experimentally evaluate whether PEBR is fast and robust using
             microbenchmarks, for which PEBR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art schemes."
